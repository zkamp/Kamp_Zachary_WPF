//Create code that sorts through fruit names and picks out pears

//Create our "fruit bowl" array

var bowlOfFruit = ["apple","banana","pear","peach"];

//Console logs the whole array
console.log(bowlOfFruit);

//How to get one fruit inside of the bowl
console.log(bowlOfFruit[1]);

//How many fruits are in the bowl?
//How many items are in the array
//Length of the array
//Dot Syntax - "use a period"
console.log(bowlOfFruit.length);

//What is the last index number of the array using the length property?
//Last index number is always one less than the length.
//bowlOfFruit.length - 1 is the last index #.
